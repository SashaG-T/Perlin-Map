# Perlin-Map
A perlin noise map generator using OpenCV.

This was mostly to learn about OpenCV and Perlin noise genertors.
It produces a decent map but could be improved upon greatly.

ESC - Generate and draw new map.

# Compiling
Must link against OpenCV and compiling using C++ compiler.
Was originally written in Visual Studio Community 2017 but I don't believe there's any compiler specific code.
If not it shouldn't be to hard to fix.
